				  	<h2>Tennis </h2>
				  	<p>I've been playing tennis since I was a kid. It's a sport I particularly enjoy because it's very competitive and always forces you to surpass yourself. Tennis has also enabled me to meet some very nice people and make a lot of friends.

				<div class="card-white">
				  	<h2>Golf</h2>
				  	<p>Golf is also one of my favorite sports, as it's extremely relaxing and very complete. I really enjoy being on my own on the golf course, as it helps me develop a better mental outlook while staying in shape physically.

				  	<h2>Cinema</h2>
				  	<p>Cinema is one of my greatest passions. I love films of all genres and origins. My favorite director is Tarantino, and my favorite film is reservoir dogs. Films allow me to escape and clear my head. They're also a form of therapy for me, as they help me to better understand the issues of life around me.

				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>I'm an avid traveler, having been to many countries around the world. My favorite country is Italy, with its magnificent landscapes and gastronomy. I'd like to continue traveling in the future, by discovering Japan for example, which I still haven't done.
